# ðŸŒ¿ Plant Disease Detection

This is a *Streamlit-based web application* that uses a trained deep learning model to detect plant diseases from leaf images. The model identifies both the plant and its disease with high confidence.

---

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- *User-Friendly Interface*: Upload plant leaf images through a simple drag-and-drop interface.
- *Wide Disease Coverage*: Detects 38 plant diseases, including healthy plant states.
- *Interactive Analysis*: Provides confidence scores and disease-specific information.
- *Real-time Results*: Processes and predicts disease in seconds.
